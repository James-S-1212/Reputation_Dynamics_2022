# Reputation_Dynamics_2022
Project for examining reputation dynamics with reinforcement learning

From console, run "graph_setup(samples, Zs, steps_played). 
- Zs: Array of population sizes, Int
- steps_played: How many learning steps to be done on the population, Int
- samples: Number of randomly genrated populations to run the "Steps_played" learning steps on. These samples will have cooperation indices averaged for output to the csv file as "cooperation index". 

Change the global vairable at the top "norm" to a different norm if desired.
